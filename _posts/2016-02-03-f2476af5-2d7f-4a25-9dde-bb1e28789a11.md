Who I Am
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/42ac9e69-b682-4be5-ad09-1bca61321613.jpg)

I am happiest on the water, in the water, near the water.  Always preferably salt water, but freshwater will do if the ocean is not near.  It is only recently that I came to understand this in a useful way, and while I could lament that it took me so long, I am actually deeply grateful that the moment is behind me instead of still to come.  Not everyone in the world ever receives the blessing of truly and intimately knowing happiness when they grow up, where it comes from for them, or even necessarily that it exists.  Oh sure, everyone gets excited when they buy a new car, earn one of life's various trophies, or when any of a host of other good things happen, but that's not the happiness I'm talking about.  Usually that is a happiness that comes into a person from outside of them, and it can only reach so deep.  Only a few nights ago I uncovered a handful of memories from when I was a young child.  In all of them my parents had taken me to the beach, where I would be overcome with so much joy that I would be compelled to strip to my naked 2-year-old skin and then take off running as fast as my legs would churn.  One side of the beach was the same as the other side, and it wasn't my goal to arrive at any particular place.  I did not sprint in order to _obtain_ anything, not a destination or a feeling, rather I sprinted because I could not contain what joy I _already had_.  It is a joy that perhaps begins in the belly like butterflies, a joy that wiggles its way up inside your chest to burst from your lungs in a shout and from your face in a smile.  Today, I believe that this joy is who we are, and it is what life is about.  The world then, is a garden which we must tend to so that everyone's joy can grow.

This is what I am about.
