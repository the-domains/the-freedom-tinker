What We are Doing Here

Freedom is the garden in which our Joy is cultivated.

The material ingredients of happiness are really very simple.  A human being needs sufficient food, shelter, clean water, companionship, mental and physical health, and freedom to live autonomously.  Once we have freedom from the needs of our material existence, we have the Freedom to foster happiness inside.  While happiness is not wholly dependent on having all of our basic needs met, it is a whole lot easier to be happy when the quality of our problem has risen from not having any food to eat, to choosing between fresh fish and quesadillas for dinner.  A man who takes a walk on a snowy night inside a warm jacket has a much easier time noticing how enchanting the night sky is--and allowing it to enchant him--than a man who is struggling with hypothermia.

It is my studied belief that there is _enough _of everything here on earth for all human beings to enjoy a life that provides all of these things.  Food, shelter, clean water, companionship, and health.  The sad truth is that despite there being enough, the vast majority of people alive today do not have all the necessary pieces to enjoy what should be their birthright if they chose to participate.  

How do we change this?  What can we do to build a world where everyone has a good shot at getting everything they need in order to nurture the Joy that they were created to embody?  It is a question with a lot of facets, and answers can be found to those facets in everything from technology to philosophy to meditation to natural medicine.  Freedom is only one word, but the question of how to build our world so that we and everyone else are able to enjoy it gives us the opportunity to talk about every subject under the sun.  Which is good, because some of us get bored easily.

A family might choose to live in a McMansion on a street of McMansions, as their method of shelter and warmth.  Or perhaps they might choose to live in a tiny sailboat bobbing on the sea, like me.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d279e6a9-1b7d-424c-9dcd-6a7fabac8f57.jpg)

Some people find happiness living out of a van they can park on the edge of a gorgeous mountain lake, and then take to the desert when the season changes.  All of these different options has merit to those who choose them, and all of them have unique technological needs that can be tuned to make the people using them _more Free_.  Lights, a heating system, refrigeration, a water source, how do we make ourselves self-reliant in all these needs, in whatever lifestyle we have chosen?  We are going to talk about that here.

Material Freedom is the product of a mindset.  The family that chose to live in the McMansion is going to have a more difficult time being free than I do, living on a tiny sailboat.  Their bills are going to be bigger because their consumption of resources is bigger.  It was their choice to live that lifestyle, and their choice was the product of their mindset.  So how do we alter our ways of thinking in order to make decisions which give us more freedom instead of less?   We are going to talk about that here.
